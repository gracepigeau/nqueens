# N Queens
The N-Queens problem is an extension of the eight queens puzzle developed in 1848 by Max Bezzel. Each queen is placed on a NxN chess board so that no two queens share the same row, column, or
diagonal

# Motivation
Project is/was created for CISC 352 at Queen's University for Professor Kaos in 2017.

# Use + Testing
The script takes in a single .txt file which contains a list of integer N values. It generates a single solution to the N-Queens problem for each N value and outputs all solutions to a single .txt file. A sample input and and output .txt have been included.
