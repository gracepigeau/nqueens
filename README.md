# N Queens
The N-Queens problem is an extension of the eight queens puzzle developed in 1848 by Max Bezzel. Each queen is placed on a NxN chess board so that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal

# Motivation
Project is/was created for CISC 352 at Queen's University for Professor Kaos in 2018.

# Use
The script takes in a single .txt file which contains a list of integer N values. It generates a single solution to the N-Queens problem for each N value and outputs all solutions to a single .txt file. A sample input and and output .txt have been included.

An example solution for a board of size 4 would be output in the format:

[ 3, 1, 4, 2] 

Where the number in each column corresponds to the row in which the queen is placed.

The time taken to generate each board is printed to the console, and the script can solve for N-values ranging from 4 to 10,000,000 in under 60 seconds.
